Development paragraphs for each meeting.

4/15/21:

This meeting served to be an indepth discussion about the exact details for the final project implementation. We discussed the best way to use the data in a graph format, ultimately deciding on using vectors for avoiding memory leak issues and linked list complexity, where there would be a vector for each airport with nodes including destination and location. Additionally, we discussed the details of understanding the dataset, what each column means, and what data we were going to include in the graph. By next meeting, we decided on trying to implement the graph for the dataset and a euclidian distance calculator function, as only coordinates are given instead of actual distance between location and destination.

This meeting served as a check-in about the last meeting's tasks and prepare for the mid-project checkin slotted for tomorrow. At this point, the bulk of the graph creation and data setup is complete with a distance function also created. Based on our schedule we defined at the initial meeting, we are a little bit behind, as the graph creation functions need finishing and the distance function still needs to be implemented to work with the rest of the cods. For next meeting, we would like to physically draw test graphs to create test cases for our graph creation. Additionally, we would like to simultaneously start working on the 3-algorithm implementation. 

4/29/21:

This meeting has been slow for everyone in the group with the end of semester assignments and catching up on missed material for different classes. Overall, there was not much development, though we should have much more freetime in the following weeks and will make an effort to pursue creating each algorithm and test cases. Zhenyu will work on finishing the graph builder and DFS, Minwoo will implement IDDFS, and Daniel A. will implement Dijkstras. 

5/06/21:

This meeting served to catch up on everyone's progress that we wanted to pursue since last week's meeting. In line with the timeline proposed in the goals meeting earlier in the semester, we have completed the implementation of all algorithms with test cases showing that our implementations are indeed working as intended. The final steps will be finishing the writing sections of the final project and creating/recording the presentation. 

5/12/21:

This is the final meeting of the semester and of the project. At this point, we have finished all algorithm, test case implementations, and the creation of the presenation. Today, we finalized the presentation recording submission and will just need to finalize the test cases portion of the readme and create a results page showing the results of our finalized product by midnight today.
